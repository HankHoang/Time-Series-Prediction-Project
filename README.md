# Time-Series-Prediction-Project
## Making Time Series Prediction Model on LA Crime Dataset

The dataset records instances of criminal activities in Los Angeles starting in 2020. The information is transcribed from written crime reports, which may contain errors. Some location fields may have missing data and are indicated as (0°, 0°), while address fields only provide approximate information to protect privacy. 
The project is to predict the possible time in which illegal behaviors can happen in the future. Therefore it can support the police department in preparing and preventing criminals in time.
